## Goal
The goal of this exercise is to learn how to think in React. There are thousands of tutorials online but there's no better way to learn than hacking it yourself.

## Requirements
You need to be confortable writing JavaScript (ES6: Module system, class, destructuring assignment).
You need to have `node`and `npm`installed in your computer.

## Technologies
The focus will be given to React but to create a simple workflow, we will need few tools (JS fatigue):
- Webpack
- Babel-loader
- Jsx support
- Live reloading (Live-server)

Oh no, you won't need that! We promise you React on the menu so let's focus on React!!
We create a package that will do that grunt work for you: [hackages](https://github.com/hackages/hackages)
You don't need to know anything about it unless you're very curious. Just run `npm start`and you'll be good to go.

## Getting started:

Just clone this [repository](https://github.com/alexlbr/hackjam-react) and run `npm start`

An example of the application is available [here](http://hackjam.hackages.io/)
